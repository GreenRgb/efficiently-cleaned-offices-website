            <p>The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of www.efficientlycleanedoffices.com (“we” or “us” or “Site”).

We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name and/or e-mail address) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party.</p>
            <p>We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site). This Site only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the event that they have signed up to receive our free newsletters or have purchased one of our products. This Site collects personally identifying information from our users during online registration and online purchasing. All of this information is provided to us by you.</p>
            <p>We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect information about your computer’s connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie” to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns.</p>
            <p>The Site also includes links to websites we endorse or sponsor and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. Some of the links we provide are “affiliate links.” This means if you click on the link and purchase the item connected to that link, we will receive an affiliate commission. When you access another website or purchase third-party products or services through the Site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.</p>
            <p>We may also make some content, products and services available through our Site through cooperative relationships with third-party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear on the Site in connection with such content, products and/or services. We may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider partner’s use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for more information.</p>
