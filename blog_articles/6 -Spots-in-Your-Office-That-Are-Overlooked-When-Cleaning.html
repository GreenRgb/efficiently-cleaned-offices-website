                <p>Whether you hire a cleaning company or ask your employees to carry out the cleaning tasks, you might think your work environment is spotless. However, often some areas are overlooked during the cleaning process.</p>
                <p>Although not all of them are noticeable, you can’t imagine all the places where you can find dust and grime.</p>

                <p>We made a list of the six most common spots that need your attention.</p>
                <p class="blog-subtitle">6 Spots in Your Office That Are Overlooked When Cleaning</p>
                <p>As a business owner or manager, you’re probably aware of the importance of keeping your office clean to promote a healthy and productive work environment. However, when you’re busy running a business, it can be easy to let tidying up fall to the wayside. But if you don’t pay attention to your office hygiene, it can hinder productivity. </p>
                <p>Fortunately, there are a few places that are often missed when cleaning, that can be spotless quite easily.</p>
                <p class="blog-subtitle">1. Vents and fan</p>
                <p>These areas of the office can attract a lot of dust. Easy to miss, the dust will get sucked into vents where it builds up over time. When a fan is not clean, it’s a breeding ground for germs and bacteria, and it can spread to other areas in the room.  For efficiency and air quality, these areas need regular cleaning.</p>
                <p class="blog-subtitle">2. Computers</p>
                <p>Studies have found that office computers can have high levels of bacteria. Using your work equipment while it’s dirty can lead to all kinds of nasty, attention-grabbing diseases. Like any other surface in the office, computers need cleaning, even if you might not notice those crumbs or greasy fingerprints.</p>
                <p class="blog-subtitle">3. Inside of Your Desk Drawers</p>
                <p>It’s also necessary to clean out the things inside your desk drawers. If you find that these drawers are often cluttered, then you need to invest some time to organize them. Cleaning out the items in your drawers will help to prevent any clutter that can potentially lead to accidents if mishandled. The bonus is, you might find your favorite pen that you lost six months ago!</p>
                <p class="blog-subtitle">4. Blinds</p>
                <p>Without regular cleaning, your office window coverings will inevitably gather dust.  All that dust will spread around your office and we all know that is unhealthy. Whether your blinds are vacuumed or wiped you will notice an improvement in your workspace.</p>
                <p class="blog-subtitle">5. Bins</p>
                <p>Bins often get overlooked when cleaning because they do not hold any food or wine stains, and you only need to spot-clean them. But this overlooked spot in your office can turn into a hygienic and safety hazard quickly. To avoid nasty odors and unwanted pests, be sure your bins are cleaned at least once a week.</p>
                <p class="blog-subtitle">6. The Legs of Your Office Chair</p>
                <p>The legs of your office chair have so many nooks and crannies — even the best vacuum is not able to reach them. These are the perfect place for dust to get trapped and allergies to build up.</p>
                <p class="blog-subtitle">Final Thoughts</p>
                <p>Here are six common spots in your office where you might be missing some dust or clutter that could be making your space look less than perfect.  While some of them can be carried out by your staff, we always recommend professional cleaning services.</p>
